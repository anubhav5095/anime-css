# JUST FOR FUN !!

A demo animation using HTML/CSS.
## Prerequisites

Only css and html is enough. Even though if you have basic JavaScript knowledge you can make some more interactive animations.

### For Anime Lovers

Loved doing this shitty thing during the **COVID-19** Lockdown days because of the boredom.
